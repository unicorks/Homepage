    I really love to read, which has inspired me to write a few short stories of my own! Although these were written when I was 12, I hope you like them!

    <p class="para">
        I don't know how this happened.
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, I know but it wasn't really a pleasurable experience for me.
        <br>
        <br>
        You'd like to hear my miserable tale, how I have become an almost invisible cat?
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course, you humans would love to read my tragic story.
        <br>
        <br>
        I, Trixie, was a perfectly good pet cat who stayed with her owner, Francois. Francois is a crazy scientist who thinks of many great inventions *cough* fiction storylines *cough* and works upon them.
        <br>
        <br>
        On a not-so-fine day, Francois wanted to make things invisible. Like, they're there but just not visible to us. It's difficult to explain.
        <br>
        <br>
        Francois kept to himself in his lab, and kaboomed stuff (don't ask me what he did, I'm not a geek).
        <br>
        <br>
        After what seemed like a week, the door opened and out came a... floating set of clothes?
        <br>
        <br>
        Ah, he must've succeeded in that madness invisibility liquid.
        <br>
        <br>
        But his nose, it was red like a joker's. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
        <br>
        <br>
        He came out floating with a bottle with him and he POURED THAT ICKY LIQUID ALL OVER MY LUSTROUS FUR!
        <br>
        <br>
        I felt itchy, and my skin felt like being washed with freezing Antarctic water *shudders* and I was scratching myself and running around.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let that lab be destroyed. He deserves it for making me go through this torture.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't know when I ran out of there and Francois shut the door. I was still itching like crazy, and jumping in the alley.
        <br>
        <br>
        SCREEEEEECH!
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh no, I must be invisible and somebody must've heard the noises. Great, now people think I'm a creepy ghost.
        <br>
        I'm a smart kitty, I stopped screeching, ran out of the alley and hid near a garbage dumpster. Ah, how cats like to hide in these dumpsters.
        <br>
        Note the sarcasm.
        <br>
        <br>
        When it was quiet, I slowly got out and looked in a car at my reflection.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most of my body was invisible, but my bright green eyes and claws were still visible. So that's why the person freaked out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hmmm, what should I do? Live as a dumpster diver cat forever until the invisibility wears off, or try to get in my meow-friends' coven?
        <br>
        <br>
        That won't be a good idea. I should take a relaxing bath in a tub of dye, so that I can at least look like a proper cat.
        <br>
        <br>
        I peek around, making sure nobody's there. I remember a friend of Francois', who owns a hardware shop around here.
        <br>
        <br>
        Deep breath, Trixie. You just have to go to that hardware store.
        <br>
        <br>
        I start walking near the bushes so nobody spots me. I am walking peacefully when a paper ball bonks me over the head.
        <br>
        <br>
        Am I a dustbin?
        <br>
        <br>
        I scoff and keep walking. I spot the hardware store, not far away. I sneak in from the back gate and look around for a nice, fresh tub of black paint.
        <br>
        <br>
        I jump in and relax in the tub. After some time I will be visible again till the invisibility wears off.
        <br>
        As simple as that.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hear footsteps and the unmistakable voice of the owner....
        <br>
        <br>
        "Archie, your order of black paint is ready, it will be delivered by tomorrow."
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh shit.
        <br>

            There was nothing I could do except for makeup.
            <br>

            <br>
            I noticed it properly after 4 years. I don't know why I didn't pay attention to it. My short height, my smooth baby face, my work and all my clothes which fit me the same all those years.
            <br>

            <br>
            Why didn't I notice the time attentively?
            <br>

            <br>
            Time had slowed for me.
            <br>

            <br>
            I didn't grow much in the last few years, never took much "time" to complete anything, all because time had slowed for me.
            <br>

            <br>
            The world was continuing at its own pace, and somehow this spell made it seem that my "time" fit in with this world.
            <br>

            <br>
            My family took me to several specialists to cure my growth problems. I was confused and worried. My family was suspecting that there is something different, which they couldn't put their hand on.
            <br>

            <br>
            Few days back, I took it upon myself to find out what's wrong. I wore a watch and went on to do different tasks all alone. Staying away from people would let me focus on this and I may notice the effects of the spell.
            <br>

            <br>
            I went on long walks to the forest, shut down myself in rooms for what seemed like long hours to me. But when I went to the normal time, I got to know that I had barely spent 5 minutes according to my familiars.
            <br>

            <br>
            Many of them started to notice the oddity with me. They questioned me, and I had to act like I didn't know what they were talking about.
            <br>

            <br>
            I had soon gotten tired of their questions. I wanted to do something to make it less noticeable. So, I went to the universal teacher YouTube.
            <br>

            <br>
            I watched tutorials on YouTube, and then I knew the key to my problem.
            <br>

            <br>
            Makeup.
            <br>

            <br>
            After some tries, I could do decent makeup to make myself look older than I physically am. But that isn't where the problem endsâ€¦..
            <br>

            <br>
            I hid myself behind makeup for two years. Then my family started to notice what was happening and asked about it from a shady relative that I had never heard of. My parents said that I had to stay with her to cure myself.
            <br>

            <br>
            She sounded like some kind of psycho. She kept muttering to herself at most times, and gave me some kind of judgemental looks then and now.
            <br>
            Honestly, I couldn't understand how she would cure me using those funny looks.
            <br>

            <br>
            After my time was over for staying with her, she stranded me on her porch with my bags. I didn't feel any change after being with her.
            <br>

            <br>
            I had to walk home from her house. I took the longer route as it isn't as creepy as the short way through the forest.
            <br>

            <br>
            I was tired, so I sat down for a while on a bench. I felt a tingling sensation near my thigh before getting from the bench. I checked myself for any bugs and continued walking home.
            <br>

            <br>
            I breathed a sigh of relief on reaching my home. I went inside my room, unpacked my bags and changed into comfortable nightwear.
            <br>
            Ooh, something fell out of my denims' pocket while I was changing.
            <br>

            <br>
            It was a keyring with a slip inside it. I read the slip to see if it's important or not. It said-
            <br>

            <br>
            So you're that cursed person. I know you're confused, and I can tell you what's actually happening. To know, read further.
            <br>

            <br>
            Go to your parents' room. On the right underside of their bed, there is another note. It has further info.
            <br>

            <br>
            Interesting. Though I'll read the next note tomorrow, I'm tired right now.
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>

            <br>
            I wake up in the morning, and wash up. Dressing up myself quickly, I go to my parents' room and take out the note. I go to my room and read it.
            <br>
            It said-
            <br>

            <br>
            Good. You were cursed by a passerby who randomly chose you. He is still keeping an eye on you. Your curse will be broken if you manage to make the special hat whose procedure you'll find in the attic of your house. Much love, smelly socks.
            <br>

            <br>
            Isn't that such a wonderful name for a well-wisher?!?! I find the next note in my storage box in the attic-
            <br>

            <br>
            Recipe for pretty hats for young ladies/lads-
            <br>
            (All objects must be brought from Easton Mesa Witch Hub&trade;)
            <br>

            <br>
            ~ Sewing Machine
            <br>
            ~ Spider legs fabric
            <br>
            ~ Salve of dust ritual
            <br>
            ~ Elixir of energy heads
            <br>
            ~ 3 pins of happy journeyman curse
            <br>
            +Buy villainous writer's knickers for good luck
            <br>

            <br>
            Procedure-
            <br>
            Mix any items in any way, but the end product should be a stylish hat you should wear on your head, not on your nose.
            <br>

            <br>

            <br>
            Uhhhh, what the eff are these objects? And what is "Easton Mesa Witch Hub&trade;" and how will I get all this?
            <br>

            <br>
            Unable to find any solution myself, I take the help of Google. I search for Easton Mesa Witch Hub&trade; first. This place is two blocks south of the nearest dump-
            <br>

            <br>
            What? It exists!?!?
            <br>

            <br>
            Apparently it does. I put the slip and my phone into a small bag and go to "Easton Mesa Witch Hub&trade;".
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>

            <br>
            I walk to the supposed location. To my surprise, Easton Mesa Witch Hub&trade; is a supermarket which I somehow never noticed.
            <br>

            <br>
            I enter the store and a lady asks me what I want. I silently take out the slip and show it to her. She says,"Go to Peasant's Paradise section."
            <br>

            <br>
            Excuse you, but I am no peasant. I walk over to that section anyways. I show my slip to the helper who's standing over there. They go to fetch my items and I stand there, waiting.
            <br>

            <br>
            They hand me a simple, sparkly hat which doesn't even look magical! They said, "Wearing this hat for 10 minutes will get you to the current time and you'll look normal. After 1 year, wear it for one minute.
            <br>
            If you wear it any longer, the consequences will be severe."
            <br>

            <br>
            I walk out of there and go to my home. I decide to try out this hat later in my room.
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>
            .
            <br>

            <br>
            During the night, I wake up and switch on the lights of my room. I stand in front of the mirror with a stopwatch and wear the hat. I was rapidly changing, looking older and more mature. After 10 minutes, I looked quite different from what I was 10 minutes earlier.
            <br>

            <br>
            Well, this is a quite dangerous thing to keep around. I should wear it for some more time so that I can destroy it later and look young forever!
            <br>

            <br>
            Without any more thinking, I put on the hat and stopwatch.
            <br>

            <br>
            "Oi, what do you think you are doing this late in the night? Go switch off and sleep!" shouts my mom.
            <br>

            <br>
            I keep standing there without moving. The door to my room is knocked once, twice, thrice....
            <br>

            <br>
            "Oh no, I lost count of the time which I had to wear the hat!" were my last thoughts before I aged into an old woman and died, without knowing who was 'smelly socks'.
            <br>

            <br>
            I should've brought the villainous writer's knickers as well....

            "Yay, we are going to the CONCERT!!!" shouted my annoying friend.
            <br>

            <br>
            "Shut the heck up, we're not there yet." I speak and put my hand on his mouth.
            <br>

            <br>
            Finally this idiot got quiet.

            "Round of applause for our favourite band, Lord of the Greasy Elephants!" a voice booms over the loudspeaker.
            <br>

            <br>
            "Ayyyyyyyyyyye!!!!" yells my friend while clapping like an overexcited pig.
            <br>

            <br>
            I feel so lucky! I'll be seeing my favourite band that too LIVE!!! OMG!!!!
            <br>

            <br>
            Me and my friends are full-on fangirling while waiting for them to come onstage.
            <br>

            <br>
            *thump*
            <br>

            <br>
            The sky turns colourful due to the lighting. It feels surreal. Mind you, it's day right now. The big flashlights point towards the stage.
            <br>

            <br>
            We see a UFO descending on the stage with a ladder hanging from it.
            <br>
            Awesome, the theme is aliens. Wow!
            <br>

            <br>
            I am mesmerized by the effects. The door of the UFO opens and out comes our favourite band wearingâ€¦..capes?
            <br>

            <br>
            It was supposed to be icky green suits, not frickin' blue capes!
            <br>

            <br>
            Wait, those aren't LOTGE. Do we have visitors? Definitely. But the desired ones? Nope.
            <br>

            <br>
            They are the clawed ballpoint skeletons, armed with the spoon mimic of candy stores and riding on the zombie sheep of the west.
            <br>

            <br>
            "We have killed LOTGE, and now we will be the best music stars! Mwahahahahaha!" they chorus in their scratchy voices.
            <br>

            <br>
            I mean, what the heck? Who listens to these skeletons' music?!?! Their voice is so irritating. And I'm sure the spoon mimic of candy stores isn't an appropriate musical instrument.
            <br>

            <br>
            "We will not listen to your music. Go away!" I shout while hiding my face.
            <br>
            The crowd around me echoes it as well.
            <br>

            <br>
            "We are not here to yodel like a banshee, we are here to take away the most musical animal to our planet, the pigs!"
            <br>

            <br>
            Hold the heck up- they want musical pigs?
            <br>

            <br>
            I don't think that I, or any other human for that matter- has seen pigs singing a melody beautiful enough to melt hearts. But these skeletons' look like they have heard the heart-wrenching, enchanting squeals of pigs and want to have them.
            <br>

            <br>
            I am conflicted. One part of my brain is telling me to give away the pigs, who even likes them anyways? The second part has itself focused on a cute pig picture that I saw years ago and miraculously remembered it now. And the third part is telling me to do some PE.
            <br>

            <br>
            "Alright. Whatever. Take those pigs, who wants them anyways?"
            <br>

            <br>
            Snap. With a click of the leader skeleton's fingers, pigs fly. Literally. The pigs float up in the sky, near to the fleet of UFOs.
            <br>

            <br>
            "Buckle up, my inky army. We are leaving in... 1....2....3!" shouts the leader and then steam shoots out from the zombie sheep's butts, propelling them straight into the sky. I think one skeleton and his sheep launched upwards so hard that they burned up. Idiots.
            <br>

            <br>
            Freezed. Everything freezes suddenly, everything is still and silent.
            <br>

            <br>
            *insert extravagant pig squeal*
            <br>

            <br>
            "I am the Pigselator, the guardian angel of these innocent pigs! I will not let you take them away, sucky ballpoint sticks!" booms a very squealy voice.
            <br>

            <br>
            A very badass looking pig-human comes forward, gliding through the air on a high-tech haystack. The person is wearing some cool glasses with a pig ears hairband. A tail is also sticking out from it's back.
            <br>

            <br>
            The pig-person puts their hands in their pockets, and takes out an intoxicated sailor from its pocket, and yeets it in the face of head zombie. SoMeHoW, the leader also gets a bit intoxicated and loses concentration on the pigs. They drop back to the places where they came from.
            <br>

            <br>
            Phew, atleast no pig poop would be left to clean up.
            <br>

            <br>
            And the Pigselator vanishes in a hayshower.
